### Description

* LAST BUG FIX SEP 19, 2000 * <p>

This English Explorer is a 'Microsoft WebBrowser contol' based browser.<br><br>

The original development site is http://www.yasuaki.com/eetp

<br><br>

When you right-click on any word in the browser,

a window pops up and shows, says the meaning of it. ( It actually passes arguments to URL and gets the rest from the Internet. You can customize the URL very easily)

<br><br>

This software was originally devleloped as an English training tool. THE CODE WORKS BUT IS *EXTREMELY UGLY*.

I had to abandon the development because of my busy job situation so I decided to release the code *as is* in a hope to keep it alive.

<br><br>

I'd like to make this open source but not sure if it's legally possible because I have used code from other authors on planet-source-code.com

<br><br>

anyway, MODIFICATION / FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IS ENCOURAGED. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, PLEASE SEND THEM TO yasu@yasuaki.com

<br><br>

Requirements:

<br>* Visual Basic 6.0 ( or maybe later)

<br>* Internet Explorer 5.0 or 5.5 ( or maybe later)

<br>* Microsoft text-to-speech engine. ( I think Win2k has it by default ). If you don't have it, you can download the Microsoft Speech SDK from http://www.microsoft.com/iit/

<br><br>

BETTER TECHNOLOGIES WANTED:<br>

The most difficult and the core technology of this software is finding what word is under the mouse cursor. The current solution is to insert <span onmouse...> tags on all the words but this isn't reliable and has a lot of bugs. It has difficulties with frames, too. If you can think of any other methods, please post them!!

<br><br>

other notes:

I've also included python-based script I run on my server to provide dictionary contents. <br>
